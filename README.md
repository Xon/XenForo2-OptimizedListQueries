# OptimizedListQueries

Optimized query for getting threads in a forum with large number of threads, or for conversations with a very high page count, and Likes Received/Reactions.

The Likes/Reactions received, conversations & forums use limit & offset to implement paging through the result set. 

MySQL implements 'early row lookup' which results in the large select statement pulling in more data than is required.

Ideally conversations would implement the position system like posts do, which would be even faster than using sub-selects to force 'late row lookup'.
